This file is used to fixup places where I just couldnt emulate it properly


This code is using a zero for DS, which will never work.  It looks like
it has read a zero from somewhere earlier, but I cannot figure out where
right now, so:
  Hardcode it to use the TEXT seg.

-00035f99 0f b7 42 26 50
movzx eax, word [edx + 0x26]
push eax

+00035f99 6a 08 90 90 90
push 8
nop nop nop
